### fourth Commit

changed some colors made the background colors more complimentory towards the moving squares.  I plan for the squares to move slower.  Trying to animate the colors of the background rectangles that the squares move on. THe colors still need work and the blue needs to be changed.  I feel like something is missing as well.
