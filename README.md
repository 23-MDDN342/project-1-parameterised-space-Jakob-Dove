### Final Thoughts

This project is a p5.js sketch that functions as a zoom background.  The background should be able to work at any scale. The goal was to make a looping background. This project takes influence from the sunset, and candy distribution. I am pleased that I got something to loop.  I am very pleased with the colors even if the pink color is hard to see. I like that the background is bright and that all the colors kind of work together. There was a lot of experiementation to get where it needed to be. Looping the items you see on the canvas was hard to do but so rewarding when I finally figured it out! In conclusion, I am glad there is a finished project that works!
